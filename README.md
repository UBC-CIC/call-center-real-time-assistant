# E-Comm 911 Connect Virtual Assistant

## Project Summary

The E-Comm 911 Connect Virtual Assistant tool serves to assist non-emergency call takers in identifying the nature and
scenario of incoming calls and moving ahead with the correct standard procedures, leading to increase in overall
efficiency and accuracy in call-taking. Procedure recommendations are based on keyphrase similarity in ElasticSearch
between the currently transcribed call and transcripts of audio call files provided by the user.
